# HW My Sort

## Description:

This README contains a C++ program that implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program also includes functions to print array values, calculate sorting statistics, check if the array is sorted in ascending order, and perform comparisons and swaps during sorting. The main function initializes an array with random values, performs some comparisons and swaps, sorts the array using the implemented mySort function, prints the sorted array, prints sorting statistics, and checks if the array is sorted correctly.
